# Azure GRC Automation – Entra Global Admin Monthly Report

This project automates the monthly export of *&Entra ID Global Administrators** using an **Azure Automation Runbook**, a **User-Assigned Managed Identity (UAMI)**, and **Microsoft Graph**.  
The script generates an audit-ready access report and emails it to the security team to support GRC and IAM review workflows.
